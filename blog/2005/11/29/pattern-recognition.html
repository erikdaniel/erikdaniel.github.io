    <p>With all deference to <span class='ljuser'  nowrap;'><a href='http://aurorabell.livejournal.com/profile'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17'  bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://aurorabell.livejournal.com/'><b>aurorabell</b></a></span>, I never watched Buffy.  I did not have an adverse opinion towards it, I just never watched it. Kind of like Lost. In fact, I haven't watched much beyond the Food Network since the last decent Star Trek show was canceled, and that was not Enterprise my friends.</p><br /><a name="cutid1"></a><br /><p>That said, I went to a movie over the summer called <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0379786/">Serenity</a> which happened to be written and directed by Joss Whedon, just like Buffy. The movie wasn't awe inspiring. It wasn't the greatest sci-fi I have ever seen. It did have <i>something</i> though. I had never heard of any of the actors, and they were decent. The story wasn't altogether brand new, but it was solid. The effects were tight as well, if not Star Wars:E3 tight.</p><br /><p>The film was a continuation of a television show called <i>Firefly</i>, also by Mr. Whedon, which survived but one season. I revolves around the crew of the space vessel <i>Serenity</i>. The show's description from IMDB: <blockquote>In the distant future, Captain Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds is a renegade former interstellar officer now turned smuggler/rogue whom is the commander of a small spacecraft with a loyal hand-picked crew making up of first mate Zoe Warren; pilot Hoban 'Wash' Washburn; gung-ho grunt Jayne Cobb; engineer Kaylee Frye; rogue scientist Simon Tam and his psychic sister River, where they travel the far reaches of space in search of food, money, and anything to live off on.</blockquote></p><br /><p>I rented the first couple disks of this show over the holiday and I was not at all disappointed.  Surprised to find the same cast as the film, with almost as fine production value, I could barely look away until I had watched all 8 episodes I had rented. Bean even liked it.</p><br /><p>I am not sure how the show ever got made in the United States. It seems more like a Canadian show. The characters have more depth that your average slip of paper. The show touches on fuzzy morality, religion, and totalitarianism a little much for the American Media to stomach I think. Maybe that's why it got the shaft so soon.</p><p>If you get the chance, check it out. Fans of science fiction will not be disappointed.</p>
