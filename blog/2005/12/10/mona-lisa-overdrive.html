    <p>I finally caught a minute this week to update <a href="http://a2slam.com">A2Slam.com</a> concerning our iWPS qualifier. If you want the round by round <a href="http://a2slam.com/ann-arbor-poetry-slam/34/december-slam-recap/2/">here it is (sans scores)</a>.  If you don't feel like clicking, <strong>Versiz</strong> will be representing Ann Arbor at iWPS in February. Yes, <a href="http://iwps2005.poetsasylum.org/"><i>that Versiz</i></a>.  He has been showing up at our slam on and off all year.  Let me tell you what the rankings don't, he barely got by <span class='ljuser' style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://rosa-ostrina.livejournal.com/profile'><img src='http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif' alt='[info]' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;' /></a><a href='http://rosa-ostrina.livejournal.com/'><b>rosa_ostrina</b></a></span> in the final round. In fact, the third round was flat out awesome, and I would be glad to send any one of those poets to carry Ann Arbor's banner, if those four turn out to be our team, I would be happy as hell.</p><br /><p>On a more personal note, my friend, who finally got back after 13 months in Iraq, is in town visiting and I couldn't be happier.  We all took off early from work on wednesday to hang out, get drunk, and talk about old times.  It was great. He seems like he weathered the experience pretty well, despite being subjected to the horrors of humanity.  He tells me that he's almost settled in to civilian life, and he is doing fine. Well then, Sergeant, so am I.</p><p>I finally caught a minute this week to update <a href="http://a2slam.com">A2Slam.com</a> concerning our iWPS qualifier.
