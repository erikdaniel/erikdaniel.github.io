    <p>In the <a href="http://erikdaniel.com/2009/12/25/always-moving-part-1">last entry</a>, I explained briefly how this site was setup in Drupal, including the addition of a new content type, called portfolio. In this entry, I'll briefly go over the creation of the theme, which I call "Always Moving".</p>

<blockquote>Designing pages in HTML is a lot like having sex in a bathtub. If you don't know anything about sex, it won't help to know a lot about bathtubs.<br />-Michael Kaufman</blockquote>

<!--break-->

<p>Highest on my list of design needs was the word "clean", and second was the word, "readable". It was tempting to create the site in Flash, or design it around a bunch of the hottest AJAX effects, but I have never been a "form over function" type of person. Since the visitors would be on the site to find and read content, I needed to design the site with readability on the forefront.</p>

<p>I started with pencil sketches of the layout, which was probably overkill for a simple blog, but I hadn't done statics for a site in a little while, and I felt I needed the polish. (Incidentally, if you are looking for a decent primer on the fundamentals of web layout, I like <a href="http://www.principlesofbeautifulwebdesign.com/">The Principles of Beautiful Web Design</a> by Jason Beaird.) After I had a pencil wireframe I liked for the landing page, content list page, and individual content page I started in Illustrator.</p>

<p>Having learned a different vector editing program first, I find Illustrator a little clunky, so I use it for blocking in shapes and quick sizing and layout, then move everything into Photoshop for polish. I am comfortable using entirely one or the other, but again, this was an exercise.</p>

<p>I created the landing page and that was it. Without the need for a client to sign off on all the statics, I could base the internal pages on the landing page and skip the extra work.</p>

<p>For the theme, I used the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/zen">Zen Theme</a>, which gave me a standards-compliant starting point with all the building blocks I needed. I had the basic design up on my local server in a few hours.</p>

<p>This is the point where the "designer" part of me really came out. If you have ever written the HTML/CSS for a graphic artist's own site, based on their design, you will know what I am on about. You end up doing the work again and again because designers are never satisfied with their own work. Apparently, I am no different. When I saw the design in a browser, I hated it.</p>

<p>Not wanting to design in HTML and CSS, I backed up to Photoshop. The layout was fine, I just hated the colors and typography. I had started with a light-on-dark theme that just didn't seem readable to me when I loaded it in a browser. The redesign then became dark-on-light, with the green and gray colors you see. I think its a lot easier on the eyes. I found some great illustrations for accents at the <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pp/pphome.html">Library of Congress</a>, and the look was done.</p>

<p>All that was left was to create a cool view for the portfolio content. I'll save that for another post.</p>
