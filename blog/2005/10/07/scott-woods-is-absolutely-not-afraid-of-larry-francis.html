    <p>Scott Woods was out on Tuesday night, as you may already know from reading his lj.  I happened to be in A2 early, having had to drop some materials at a place in Canton. As luck would have it, Scott and Karrie W. were there for early as well, and were kind enough to allow me to join them. Me, and the 2 least stereo typical librarians in all of the Midwest I am sure. It was a really pleasant dinner.</p><br /><p>Scott's feature was perfect as always. The crowd was a little lacking, though, and I must say I was slightly ashamed of it. Scott tore it  up, though. He did a piece, "Swimming with the Whales" about the 327 times he nearly died while writing in his car.  It had the coolest images of the road I've heard.  It really took me back to the old truck driving days. Thanks, Scott.</p>
