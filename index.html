      <p>I am a father, husband, web developer, student, poet and occasional ninja. I worked for a small design firm in Dearborn, Michigan called <a href="http://landmine-design.com">Landmine Design</a> where I designed web sites and kicked the server from 2003 to 2010. Right now I work for <a href="https://www.duosecurity.com">Duo Security</a> in Ann Arbor. My expertise is HTML, JavaScript and CSS, with a side of mobile and a splash of devops.</p>
      <p>I love open-source tech, like <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, and <a href="http://node.js">Node.js</a>. If you need some help using any of those in your business, <del>I'm here for you, <a href="/connect">contact me</a></del><ins> contact <a href="http://landmine-design.com">Landmine</a></ins>.</p>
      <p>I am a somewhat stereotypical nerd, though lately I put down the controller more often than not to play with my daughters, or go for a run.</p>
      <p>A few years ago I earned a couple of black belts, including a second degree in American Kenpo. I still check in occasionally to make sure I still have it. So far I do.</p>
      <p>I used to write a lot, including a whole book of poetry. At some point I discovered poetry slam. I have been hooked ever since. In my sparse spare time, I volunteer for <a href="http://poetryslam.com">Poetry Slam, Inc.</a> the non-profit  organization that handles the largest poetry slam events in the world. Since 2004, I have served as the Chairman of the Rules and Protest Committee, as well as acting as Tournament Director for several Individual World Poetry Slams, and the National Poetry Slams from 2009 to today. I handle their web site as well.</p>
